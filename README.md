# Krathalan's Scripts
This repository is a collection of scripts I wrote and use/modify regularly. You may have to modify a line or two in each script to get it to work on your machine; for example, there is a hard-coded "/home/anders/GitLab/" directory in `update_git_repos`. These scripts are provided without warranty in the hope that you will find them useful. Contributions are accepted, just open an issue or a pull request.
