# Krathalan's Scripts
This repository is a collection of scripts I wrote and use/modify regularly. You may have to modify a line or two in each script to get it to work on your machine/setup. These scripts are provided without warranty in the hope that you will find them useful. Contributions are accepted, just open an issue or a pull request.

Please don't run these scripts without reading them first. Always read a script before running it on your machine, especially if it requires sudo/root privileges.
